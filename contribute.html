    <h1>How did this legacy contribute to the lives of the Egyptians? Modern Day?</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Egyptians Lives:</strong> <br>
      Egyptians used Writing as a tool for reports, storytelling and language. Hieroglyphics were key to how the egyptians told their storys about their modern day life. Sculptures helped egyptians represent and worship their gods. The sculptures also could show how royal somebody was, you could tell this by looking at their stance, and what they wore.

      <br>
      <strong>Modern Day:</strong> <br>
      In our modern day, we use writing for many different things, without writing we probably wouldent be able to study at school. Without written language, english wouldent be writable, and for example "Tt" wouldent be understandable as "Tee". Sculpting nowadays is a very common thing, and some sculptures are old and mean alot to people, some sculptures are made to recognize somebody, or somebodys <strong>Legacy</strong>..
