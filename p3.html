    <h2>Sculptures and Written Language</h2>
    <h1>Reasoning and Supporting Evidence #3</h1>
    <p>
      The written language (Hieroglyphics) were made up of symbols that looked like living creatures, objects or other symbols. The symbols usually meant sounds, or movements. But, the Hieroglyphics were hard to master and required time to memorize, so scribes created a simplified version of the Hierogyphics, called Hieratic, both forms of writting could be written forwards to back, back to forwards or up and down, the hieroglyphics helped arceologist understand the religion of the Ancient Egyptians, this is why i chose this Legacy.
