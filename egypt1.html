    </div>
    <p>The egyptians used scupltures and written language to tell stories of their afterlife, events that happened over time, reports, and messaging.</p>
    <p>they accomplished this by hiring workers and slaves to come make the clay tablets for a couple months, or get scibes to write in hieroglyphics on stones for reports etc.
    </p>
    <p>The egyptians accomplished sculpting by also hiring workers or slaves to come build, and would use mud bricks to make pyramids, or other sculptures.
    </p>
    <p>Because of this, scientists and archaeologist have uncovered the Egyptian culture, from reading inside temples, and storage systems the egyptians one used.
