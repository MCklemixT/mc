    <h2>Sculptures and Written Language</h2>
    <h1>Reasoning and Supporting Evidence #2</h1>
    <p>
      The sculptures in egypt represented gods, famous workes, pharaos, and rarely slaves, the sculptures' materials depended on what they liked or what rank the sculptures meaning was. (like if it was a pharaoh, it would be made in more expensive stone). The scupltures could also have different characteristics, like how some statues have a male figure with their left foot out, and their body is stiff showing no expression. The statues could have been made of wood (rare), obsidian (un-common), or usually limestone/mudbricks (common). Limestone was common becuase it was cheap, yet it could be easily worn by water or rain, but it never rained in Egypt, so limestone stayed as it was, and only had few different features worn from time (4000-5000ya).
